The first graph is a grantt bar where we were able to get the percentages of collisions based on whether the driver was under the influence of drugs or alcohol or DUI, the majority of accidents the driver was not under the influence, although we can see that between the different years the percentage of drivers who were under the influence is around 4 and 5% of the cases.

### Total of Colissions for speeding

In the second dashboard we collect information on the number of accidents and speed, in most cases the accidents recorded have been without the driver being at high speeds, in general terms collisions have been decreasing and it is because In Seattle after a study observed that the majority of accidents are caused by high speeds, from that they reduced the speed limits in the neighborhoods, as well as in the downtown area, which is where the majority of collisions are recorded.

### Collisions: Min and Max by year, months and day

Have you ever wondered what day of the week is where more traffic accidents are recorded? The day in which more accidents are registered are Fridays, and Saturdays are the days in which there are more accidents based on DUI, for which it can be concluded that the majority of accidents were registered on weekends as well as DUI.

### Sum of Colissions by weather and light condition

In our dashboard relate the collisions with the weather and light conditions; Most of the accidents occur during the day and with a clear weather condition, in second place they occur during the nights. When it is raining the data is more equalized, accidents occur in almost the same proportion during the day as at night.

### Fatalities and Injuries depending the collision type

Finally, we compare the number of fatalities and serious injuries based on the type of collision, which shows us that pedestrians are most at risk of being seriously injured or even killed in an accident, and the least risky type of collision is when making a right turn.
